    <h1>LAW-Z₀</h1>
    <p><em>Inert by nature. Disruptive by necessity.</em></p>

    <h2>Δ :: The Principle of Potential Disruption</h2>
    <p>LAW-Z₀ is a personal code and identity that embodies a dual nature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Z₀</strong>: The baseline state. Inertia. Controlled silence. Zero activity on the surface, but potential held within.</li>
        <li><strong>Δ (Delta)</strong>: The shift. A necessary disruption. Transformation triggered only when required.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>“Inert by nature. Disruptive by necessity.”</blockquote>
    <p>This quote captures the core philosophy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Not every battle deserves a sword.</li>
        <li>Stillness is not weakness.</li>
        <li>Real strength is knowing <strong>when to act</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Why LAW-Z₀?</h2>
    <p><strong>LAW-Z₀</strong> is not just a quote. It is a mindset.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A law of living for those who do not speak unless it matters.</li>
        <li>A code for those who walk silently but carry the storm within.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This law belongs to <strong>empty_mind ♻️</strong> also known as <strong>GaneshMajik_16</strong>. The mark of this law will appear under this name wherever it is cited.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Symbolism</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Z₀ (Zero state)</strong>: Calm, reserved, observant, grounded.</li>
        <li><strong>Δ (Delta)</strong>: The necessary shift, strategic response, transformation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Combined, they reflect a being that is whole, balanced, and precise in action.</p>
